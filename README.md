# check-pc
This is a script that checks CPU and memory usage on several different computers and add the information into a CSV file.

By using the Psutil library, the python program access the windows data on hard driver free space, CPU usage and memory usage. 
Currently this program checks 11 times serveral (43) computers on my workplace and updates a single csv file that I use to check pc usage across the company.
